Hello Everybody,

As a result of my painful learning experiences of embedding C++ in perl, and then doing various nested callbacks, I have written a small essay on the topic, with a full ( 1 file based ) example.
For those that are interested, please go to http://www.ompa.net/perl2c2perl2c.html, and for other Inline and Jabber related stuff http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/.

Cheers.
