Why does my input record separator change after I import Inline?

This behavior occurs with every Inline module I've tried, and doesn't
occur when I import any of the modules that Inline depends upon, nor
when I require Inline, so I'd conclude that it's somewhere in Inline's
deep magic that I don't understand. :-)

Thanks,
